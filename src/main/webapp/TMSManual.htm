Monitoring System (TMS)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Train Monitoring System (TMS) is web-based software that can be used to
quickly identify active trains that meet specific criteria with respect to last
reported division and/or train delay.</p>

<p>TMS has the ability to provide additional information such as train consist,
<span class=SpellE>ETAs</span>, train event history, and to show the current
locations of trains on a map.</p>

<p><b>Accessing the Application<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>Open Internet Explorer and go to http://nsight.nscorp.com/locomotiveSystems.
This is the Locomotive Systems Main Menu Page. There are 2 ways to get to the
TMS application. <br>
<br>
1. Mouse over the Locomotive Executive Info System (EIS) and click on the Train
Monitoring System (TMS) <br>
2. Click on the Locomotive Executive Info System (EIS).This will take you to
the Locomotive EIS Main Page. Click on the TMS link. </p>

<p>If your computer has been upgraded with the required plug-<span class=GramE>in(</span>preferred
Java 1.4 <span class=SpellE>plugin</span>) , you will be taken directly to TMS.
Your browser will load TMS and it will appear as a separate window on your
screen. If you do not have the Java plug-in, a window will instruct you to call
NSS and ask them to create a ticket for <span class=SpellE>PCLan</span> to
install the plug-in. </p>

<p><b>TMS Main Screen<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>This screen is where the user will do all of their searches for trains. The
user has the ability to search for a particular train symbol, all trains at a
particular origin or destination, all trains on a division, a preset list of
train symbols, or the user’s predefined train list. To further narrow down the
trains returned, the user can use the check boxes to show a list of trains with
the specified criteria.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Users can store
customized train lists and profiles if they have a valid Identity Services
password (also known as an LDAP password).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Users must contact their security point-of-contact (SPOC) for Identity
Services access or password resets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Refer to <a href="#LoginFunctionality">Additional Functionality Available
by Logging into TMS</a> for more information about the customization features.</p>

<p>There are two different views for this application:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the Transportation view and the Intermodal
view.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both views return the same trains,
but they return different information about the trains.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><u><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Functionality
Available without Logging into TMS<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p><b>Searching for Trains<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>Click on the rectangle that is titled &quot;Train List.&quot; When you
select a new train list, the application will rebuild the train symbols drop
down list with all of the train symbols assigned to the selected train list.
Select a specific train from the train symbols or leave the default selected
(all trains) and click on ‘Fetch Data’. This will retrieve all active trains
for the specified list or the specific train. The application will display the
train symbol, status (Ordered, On Time, Behind, Late, or No <span class=SpellE>Rept</span>),
whether a train is relative to its schedule, the time of the last reporting,
the station of the last reporting, the event type last reported, number of
loaded cars, number of empty cars, total weight of the train (in tons), length
of train, the train’s originating station, and the train’s destination station.
Any train that has a status of late is more than 2 hours behind schedule.
Trains with the status of No <span class=SpellE>Rprt</span> have not had a
reporting within the last 6 hours. The user can sort by any of the columns by
clicking on the column header or rearrange the columns by clicking and holding
onto the column and moving to the desired location. The user can also sort in
descending order by holding the shift key down and clicking on the column
header. </p>

<p>For <span class=SpellE><b>InterModal</b></span><b> View</b> the user should
first check the &quot;<span class=SpellE>InterModal</span> View&quot; check box
and then click the 'Fetch Data' button. The application will display the train
number, ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) , delay information, the time of the
last reporting, the location of the last reporting, the event type last
reported, number of loaded cars, number of empty cars, number of stack <span
class=SpellE>cars,length</span> of the train, train's origin station and the
train's destination station. </p>

<p>The user can drill down on each train to get further details such as
Schedule, Event History, Consist, Map, <span class=SpellE>InterModal</span>
Scanner and Excel. Clicking on Schedule will bring up a new window displaying
the train’s schedule and other data related to the schedule. Clicking on Event
History will show each reporting, scanner and CTC event that the train has had
from its origin. Consist will show all locomotives and railcars reported on the
train. <span class=SpellE>InterModal</span> Scanner Details will show the
sequence, car, equipment and <span class=SpellE>chas</span>. <span class=GramE>initial</span>
and numbers, loaded or empty and other details related to scanner. To Excel
option will transfer the train details to an Excel file which can be saved on
the local PC. The user can sort by any of the columns by clicking on the column
header or rearrange the columns by clicking and holding onto the column and
moving to the desired location. Finally, the user can select the Map option and
display the train’s location on a map. </p>

<p>The user can search for trains <span class=GramE>with a specified criteria</span>.
The various criteria provided by the application are </p>

<ul type=disc>

</ul>

<p><b>Map Button<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>After a list of trains has been retrieved, the user can click on the ‘Map’
button to display all trains on the list. From there, the user can zoom in on
the particular area they are interested in viewing. They can use the ‘Zoom In’
button or click on the map and trace an area by holding down the mouse button
and moving the mouse. This will zoom into the area they have just drawn. Trains
are shown with circles and train symbols, stations are denoted with gray
triangles, track is shown in red, and roads shown in green. By clicking on the
boxes on the left-hand side, the user can remove or add any of the features
displayed on the map. While zoomed in, the user can click on the ‘Pan’ button
and move the map in any direction. Simply click and hold the mouse button and
drag the image in the opposite direction you want to see. This allows users to
move around at the zoomed in level instead of zooming out to the top view and
reselecting the area they want to view.</p>

<p><b>Print Button<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>The print button allows users to print the list of trains loaded on the
screen.</p>

<p><b>Help Button<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>The Help button provides information to the users on whom to contact, if
they have problems with the application</p>
