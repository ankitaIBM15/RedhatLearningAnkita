<P>Transportation Form (Add Plugged Train)</P>
</B><P>This is the form where users in the field add plugged trains to the report. The user is required to enter the plug location, 7 character train number, the time it was plugged, and their name. Optional input fields are the number of loads, empties, tons, and any comments about the train. By moving your cursor over a column header, a brief description of the column will be displayed at the bottom of the web browser.</P>
<P>The drop down list for locations has the major locations listed at the top and the rest of the stations listed below. Once a user plugs a train at a location, the next time that user brings up the Transportation Form, the previous plugged location will be listed as the default location. The user may change the location if they need to plug a train in a different location. </P>
<P>The Time of Plug column defaults to the current time in hours and minutes. The user may put in a time up to an hour prior the current time and no more into the future than four hours. The hours and minutes are to be entered in the form of hh mm. </P>
<P>Examples:</P>
<P>&#9;9:00 AM = 09&#9;00</P>
<P>&#9;9:00 PM = 21 00</P>

The user will be prompted to select the desk they are working from the drop down list and click either the Location or Time button. When the user clicks on the Location button, it will sort all of the plugged train by location. When the user clicks on the Time button, it will sort all of the plugged trains by plug time.
